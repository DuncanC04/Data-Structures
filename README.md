Duncan Craine
Connecticut College
Class of 2026

Here are the data structures I programmed in Java while using Linux in my Data Structures class taken in the Fall of 2023. 
After these assignments, I created a database that utilized some of these data structures to store "Ideas" and "Students".
"Ideas" and "Students" were specific nodes. This database serialized and deserialed data to maintain and save the data.
This database was the final project for the class which was done in a group of 5.
